- ✅ -f, --file <filename> - Loads file in editor
- ✅ -r, --reset-config - Resets configuration
- ✅ -p, --portable - Portable mode
- ✅ -n, --no-singleinstance - Allow multiple instances

===========

HotShots is an application for capturing screens and saving them in a variety of image formats as well as adding annotations and graphical data (arrows, lines, texts, ...).
You can also upload your creations to the web (FTP/some web services).
Because HotShots is written with Qt, HotShots runs on Windows, Linux (MacOSX isn't tested yet).
